# Transparent Intercity Bus Cancellation & Refund System

## 📌 Problem Statement

Intercity bus passengers frequently face **unclear, delayed, or inconsistent cancellation and refund processes**.
Refund rules vary across operators, communication is poor, and passengers often do not know:

* Whether their ticket is refundable
* How much refund they are eligible for
* When the refund will actually be processed
* Who is accountable in case of delays or disputes

This lack of transparency leads to **loss of trust**, customer frustration, and operational inefficiencies across public transport systems.

## 🎯 Objective

To design an **open, transparent, and accountable cancellation & refund system** for intercity bus services that:

* Clearly communicates refund rules upfront
* Tracks every cancellation and refund step end-to-end
* Ensures accountability of bus operators and platforms
* Builds passenger trust through verifiable data

---

## 🚍 Current Challenges

1. **Opaque Policies**

   * Refund rules differ by operator, route, and timing
   * Policies are often buried in fine print

2. **No Refund Tracking**

   * Passengers cannot track refund status in real time
   * No estimated timelines or explanations for delays

3. **Lack of Accountability**

   * Operators and platforms shift blame
   * No audit trail for disputes

4. **Manual & Error-Prone Processes**

   * Refund approvals handled manually
   * High chances of delays and miscommunication
